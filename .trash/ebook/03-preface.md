# Preface

To my coworkers from another life in a hidden lab in the mountains of Colorado. This book is done with thoughts of you all.

--

I learned so much. I grew so much.

I had no idea where learning Linux could take me.

I am forever grateful.

--

Since our time together...

i've created my own simulated annealers for model optimizatin. They get fed from genetic algorithms and then end up in committee voting machines.

I play small pairs now and I've taken your tips on the road and cashed, often.

I've settled into opening systems now: Accelerated London System, Semi-Slav, Caroâ€“Kann. 

--

I've been told that I use the terminal like "an old school linux guy".

I know what that means but i don't know what it means. lol.

i just know that I learned from you all.

Anyways... Byeee!
