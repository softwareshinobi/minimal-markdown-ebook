Howdy!

I'm Troy, a software developer & technical writer. 

I design, develop, document, and deploy software situations.

--

I've been a software developer for like 14 years or something.

I've supported activities and initiatives in the private sector, the public sector, contracting, consulting, freelancing, and all that.

Yawn... whatever.
